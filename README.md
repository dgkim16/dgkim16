## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Donghwan, but feel free to call me David.\
I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Science.\
Iâ€™m deeply passionate about exploring emerging technologies and leveraging them to create intuitive and impactful experiences.\
Over the years, Iâ€™ve been particularly captivated by virtual reality, which has driven me to work on various world design projects in this space. \
Right now, my focus is on game development, as well as exploring, implementing, and understanding open-source GPT models.
